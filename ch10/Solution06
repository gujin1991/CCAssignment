We can use the theory of merge sort to solve the problem.
First, we can divide the 20GB file into many small parts, like 500M each.
Then, we sort them separately and finally we merge them together.
Hadoop is one of the best cloud computing platform for this problem which has a Map and Reduce function and a HDFS.
