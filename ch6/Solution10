we can find the number of poisoned bottle within 7 days. 
1 change every number of bottle into binary representation
2 drop the corresponding strip if the bit of binary representation is 1
3 wait 7 days
4 see the combination of positive and negative strips and turn it into decimal

Follow up discussion:
in this problem, we can first build two class, one is Bottle and the other is
testStripe. Given an object in Bottle class, we can know its id number, set it
to be poisoned and know if it is poisoned.  Given an object in testStripe class
we can know its id number and the result of a test, put drop on it, get the bottle
number of the test and so on. then in the findPoison function, we should first 
drop the corresponding strip according to the binary representation, result the 
result after 7 days and turn the result readable.
