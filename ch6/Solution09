in this problem, the locker will be closed if it was visited even times,
because on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker. For example,
on pass 12, the state of 12th locker will be changed on pass 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
and it will be closed. therefore, we need to find the lockers which were visited
odd times after 100 pass. and i found when n is a perfect square, nth locker was
visited odd times. because there are 10 perfect squares(1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100) 
in 100, we have 10 lockers open after 100 pass.
